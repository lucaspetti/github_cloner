# Github Cloner

A CLI tool to clone github repositories.

## Getting started

To build the project:

```go build .```

Then run:

```/.github_cloner clone```

You will be prompted for a username (it can also be passed via the --user flag)

The path to clone the projects into defaults to `/home` and can be changed with the --path flag.
